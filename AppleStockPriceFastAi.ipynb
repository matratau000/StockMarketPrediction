    "## Stock Price Prediction and Visualization Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "I've been working on this exciting project where I aim to predict and visualize the closing prices of AAPL, which represents Apple Inc. Using Python and some powerful libraries, such as yfinance, pandas, and fastai, I've been able to fetch, process, and analyze historical stock price data, as well as create a machine learning model for predicting future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Fetching and Preprocessing\n",
    "First things first, I imported the necessary Python libraries, including os, yfinance, pandas, and fastai, to make all of this magic happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I specified the stock symbol, which is 'AAPL,' to focus on Apple Inc.'s stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I fetched the historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance. The data covers the period from January 1, 2010, to January 11, 2023. This data will be the foundation for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our predictions even better, I performed some feature engineering. I calculated moving averages (MA) and exponential moving averages (EMA) with different window spans and added them as features to the dataset. Of course, I made sure to remove any missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training\n",
    "Now, onto the exciting part—model training!\n",
    "\n",
    "I defined the dependent variable, which is the 'Close' price, representing the closing stock prices. For features, I selected 'Open,' 'High,' 'Low,' 'Volume,' 'MA50,' 'MA200,' 'EMA50,' and 'EMA200.' These features will help our machine learning model make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that our model is robust, I split the dataset into training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Fastai's TabularPandas, I processed the data, including normalization, as a preprocessing step. This step prepares our data for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also created data loaders (dls) to efficiently load and handle our data during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Building\n",
    "With data ready, it's time to build our model!\n",
    "\n",
    "I defined the model configuration, focusing on reduced dropout, to make sure our model generalizes well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I created a tabular learner with a simpler architecture, consisting of two hidden layers. This learner will be responsible for learning from our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the most exciting part—training the model! I trained it using the training data, specifying a learning rate and the number of epochs for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictions\n",
    "Now that our model is trained, it's time to put it to the test!\n",
    "\n",
    "I prepared the data for predictions, specifically for the dates from January 2 to January 10, 2023. This will be our \"testing\" period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the trained model, I obtained predictions on this test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "To visualize our results, I created a comparison DataFrame. This DataFrame allows us to see how well our model's predictions align with the actual closing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I used matplotlib to create a comparison plot. This plot displays the actual closing prices as well as our model's predictions. I added labels, a title, a legend, grid lines, and adjusted the layout for better aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there you have it—the visual comparison of actual vs. predicted closing stock prices for AAPL during the specified date range (January 2-10, 2023)."
